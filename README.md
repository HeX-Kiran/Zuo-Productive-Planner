## Motivation
In today's world of remote work and the ever-increasing digital demands on our time, achieving "deep work" has become a formidable challenge. Despite the abundance of productivity tools available, individuals often struggle to effectively manage their time and maintain focus. The pandemic has blurred the lines between work and personal life, making it even more crucial to find effective solutions.

Learning to harness time efficiently is not only essential for professional success but also for mental well-being and daily happiness. To address these challenges, our goal is to create the ultimate productivity tool for software engineers.

## Features
Daily Focus: Users should be able to identify and set their primary task for the day. This feature ensures a clear sense of purpose and prioritization.

Customized Pomodoro: Recognizing that the traditional 25-5-15 Pomodoro technique may not work for everyone, our tool should allow users to tailor their work and break intervals to suit their preferences and productivity patterns.

Motivational Quotes: To inspire and uplift users, the tool should provide a steady stream of motivational quotes.

## Appendix: 

To understand how we incorporate Pomodoro technique: 


User Scenario: Jane is a software engineer who wants to use the productivity tool to manage her daily tasks and incorporate Pomodoro intervals into her work routine.

Adding a Task: Jane clicks on the "Add Task" button to create a new task for the day. She enters the task name, description,  the estimated time it will take to complete the task, focus time and the break duration.

Pomodoro Timer: For the first task on her list, Jane clicks on the task to open it. Inside the task details, she sees a Pomodoro timer.

Customized Pomodoro Example: Jane selects a customized Pomodoro timer of 30 minutes of focused work followed by a 10-minute break. She saves this configuration.
Starting the Timer: When Jane clicks the "Start" button, the Pomodoro timer begins. A countdown timer appears on her screen, showing the 30-minute work session.

Break Time: After 30 minutes, the timer signals the end of the work session, and a 10-minute break timer starts automatically. Jane can relax, stretch, or take a short break during this time.

Task Completion: Once the Pomodoro session is complete, Jane marks the task as finished.

Repeating the Process: Jane repeats this process for her other tasks, adjusting the Pomodoro intervals as needed based on her workflow and preferences.

By integrating the Pomodoro technique directly into her daily task list in the productivity tool, Jane can efficiently manage her workday, maintain focus, and ensure she takes regular breaks to recharge. This feature empowers her to work more productively and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

## Conclusion
Building the ultimate productivity tool for software engineers is not just about enhancing professional efficiency; it's also about promoting mental well-being and overall happiness. This hackathon challenge invites participants to innovate, collaborate, and create a tool that can have a lasting positive impact on the lives of individuals striving for productivity in an increasingly digital world.
